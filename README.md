This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The sole purpose of this project was to learn with Firebase and Nextjs dynamic pages API. It started as a to-do list but I was seeing that literally everywhere so I decided to take a different aproach. Of course creating a Twitter crossed my mind, but actually I'm jealous of mac users that have an actual notepad on the computer and don't need a third party app.

Anyways, this project took me almost 1 week and a half and it's missing some functionalities such as sorting the notes and being able to add them styles. But we'll get to that. The purpose was achieved. I learned Authentication and Firestore and that's a neat first aproach to databases. Next step is learning SQL.
